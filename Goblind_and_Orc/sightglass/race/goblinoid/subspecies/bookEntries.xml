		Depending on who you ask, goblins and goblinoids are either untrustworthy vandals, or skilled, dedicated tinkerers. Their great proficiency with mechanical and alchemical processes often get finds them steady work, if the common compulsion to wild experimentation doesn't get them out of it later. While individually they tend to be selfish and craven, groups of goblins are capable of great coordination while working towards a common goal. With their strange appearance, short stature and high fertility, they are often unfavorably likened to common imps.
