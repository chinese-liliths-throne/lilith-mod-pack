	Arcosians are known for their cruelty and their cunning for evil, their tenacity, their will to come out on top and their durability. Arcosians have the reputation to be good at "bargains" and tyrannical rulers when in power. When "bargaining" doesn't work, they can rest assured their power and mastery over KI can offer them a much more profitable deal.
