	<p>
		Even unarmed and without their unbreakable armor, Primarchs are still human beings far above any other race, even demons and maybe rivaling Lilith herself. Their cunning and war strategies are as developed as their god-like body. Their leadership is almost otherwordly, their words are commands. Their mere presence on any field can turn the tables of a war. In many ways, Primarchs are closer to Gods than simple humans.
