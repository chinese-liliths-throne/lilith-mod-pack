		<!-- Your item can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the game to automatically re-colour your item, you can specify available colours here.

			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:

			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
		You can see a visual representation of these colours here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes

		These effects are shown in the tooltip when the player hovers over the item icon, so try and keep them short (as they should fit on one line).

		No characters are passed in as parsing arguments, so you should NOT use any character-specific parsing elements (such as [npc.name]). -->
