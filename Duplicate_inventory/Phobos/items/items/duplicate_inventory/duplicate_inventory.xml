			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:

		These effects are shown in the tooltip when the player hovers over the item icon, so try and keep them short (as they should fit on one line).

		No characters are passed in as parsing arguments, so you should NOT use any character-specific parsing elements (such as [npc.name]). -->
