	<!-- The description of this move.
	The character using this move is passed in as the 'npc' target for parsing, so commands such as [npc.name] will work.
	Special parsing arguments which can be used here are as follows:
	'damageInflicted' will parse to the attacker's projected damage of this attack (using the defined 'baseDamage' field defined below).
	'formattedDamageInflicted' will parse to a formatted damage prediction, taking into account whether or not the target is at maximum lust (therefore taking into account conversion of lust damage to health/mana damage). -->

		Use [npc.her] gloves power to summon shadowy chains that emerge from your target's own shadow, tightly binding and restraining them.

	<!-- The type of damage that this move inflicts. 
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move (and so conditional statements can be used to affect what damage type is inflicted).
	All available values of DamageType can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/combat/DamageType.java -->

	<damageVariance>NONE</damageVariance>
	
	<!-- How much damage this move blocks.
	The block type corresponds to the 'damageType' defined above.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move.
	'isCritical' will parse to the boolean return value for isCritical, and will therefore be either 'true' or 'false', depending on if the move is critically hitting or not. -->

		0

	<!-- The number of turns it takes for this move to become available for use after using it.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move.
	A value of 0 (or less) means that it can be used as many times as the attacker wants.
	The cooldown is decremented at the end of each combat round, including the current one, so a value of 1 means that this move will be available next turn (and so effectively just limits its use to once per combat turn). -->

	<!-- The StatusEffects which should be applied to the target of this move.

	<!-- The weighting for this action's chance of being selected by an AI combatant.
	The standard value for weighting is 1.0.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is using the move.
	The parsing target of 'npc2' corresponds to the character who is being targeted by the move.
	Note that this weighting is parsed for every combatant, enemy and ally alike, so the method npc2.isCombatAlly(npc) (or npc2.isCombatEnemy(npc)) should most likely be used to differentiate between friend and foe (if you have set this move as being able to be used on both allies and enemies).
	For an interesting example, see the 'spinneret_webbing.xml' file. -->
