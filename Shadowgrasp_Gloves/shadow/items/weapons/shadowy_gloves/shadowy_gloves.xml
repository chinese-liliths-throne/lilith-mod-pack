		<!-- The description that's used when equipping this weapon. The description should be generic, able to be used by both the player and NPCs. Just make sure to use the tag "[npc.verb()]" whenever using a verb, which will then, for example, parse like this:
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is player = "run"
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is not the player = "runs"
		Always use the first-person singular verb.
		The target "npc" OR "npc1" should be used for the character using the weapon. e.g. If the player is the one attacking (and is called Innoxia), then [npc.Name] will return "Innoxia"
		The target "npc2" should be used for the character being attacked. e.g. If Brax is the one being attacked, then [npc2.Name] will return "Brax"
